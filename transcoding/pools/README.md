# Pool Directory

This directory is home to pool repositories as submodules. To clone these repositories, execute the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once cloned, leverage the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files within each pool directory to launch the pool. For detailed instructions, consult the `README.md` file in each respective pool directory. Dive in and make a splash with your pool configuration!
