# Pools

This directory contains the pool repositories as a submodule. To clone these repositories, run the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can then use the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files in each pool directory to run the pool. For more information, refer to the `README.md`` file in each pool directory.
