# Exporters

Contains the exporters used in the setup. These exporters are added as git submodules to this repository because they are not published on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) yet. This allows us to update the exporters to the latest version easily. To pull these submodules, execute the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
